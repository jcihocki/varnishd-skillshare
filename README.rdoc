== Demo rails app for varnish skillshare class

This is a test app that demos how to make use of http level caching and ESI to
vertically scale a dynamic application.

There are stepped branches in the repo, with each branch demonstrating a 
different caching strategy for a new use case. 

== Caching use cases

1. Caching static content.

2. Using ESI to cache pages with private or uncacheable content.

3. Using ESI to cache static content that requires user login, like content
behind a paywall.

4. Using ESI to cache frequently used modules or fragments, like tweets in a timeline.
